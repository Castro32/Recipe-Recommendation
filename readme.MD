Project Overview:

The Recipe Recommendation Project is designed to assist users in achieving their fitness goals by providing personalized diet recommendations and recipe suggestions. Upon signing in, users input their personal data including fitness goals, current weight, and height. Based on this information, the system generates a customized diet plan and recommends recipes tailored to the user's specific goals.

System Overview:
The system incorporates several features including data inheritance, modularity, polymorphism, and functions. User authentication and data storage are managed using Firebase, while recipe data is stored in MongoDB. The backend server is implemented using Node.js with server.js as the main server file.

Functionalities:
1. User Data
User data, including personal details and fitness goals, are stored securely in Firebase.
Upon successful authentication, users gain access to the dashboard interface.

2. Dashboard Interface:
Users can view their customized diet plan based on their fitness goals (e.g., lose or gain weight).
Recipe recommendations are displayed on the dashboard, offering users a variety of meal options to choose from.
Technologies Used:
Backend: Node.js, server.js
Database: Firebase (for  data storage), MongoDB (for recipe data storage)
Additional Tools: Firestore (for managing data in Firebase)

Implementation Details:
Data Storage: User data is stored in Firebase Firestore, while recipe data is stored in MongoDB.
Diet Recommendations: The system utilizes user-provided data, such as current weight and fitness goals, to generate personalized diet plans.

Recipe Generation: Recipe recommendations are generated based on the user's dietary preferences and fitness goals.
Project Structure:
Backend: Implemented using Node.js with server.js serving as the main server file.
Database Integration: Firebase and MongoDB are integrated into the backend for user data storage and recipe data storage, respectively.

Integration of machine learning algorithms to enhance diet plan recommendations based on user data and feedback.
Implementation o
Future Improvements:f a more intuitive and interactive user interface for a seamless user experience.
Expansion of recipe database to offer a wider variety of meal options for users with different dietary preferences.

Conclusion:
The Recipe Recommendation Project aims to provide users with personalized diet recommendations and recipe suggestions to help them achieve their fitness goals effectively. By leveraging technologies such as Firebase and MongoDB, the system offers a user-friendly and efficient solution for managing dietary needs and promoting a healthier lifestyle.

Application of Functionalities:

Encapsulation:
Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. In the server file, the UserInfo schema encapsulates user data fields such as gender, age, diet_type, etc., defining the structure of user information.

Polymorphism:
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Polymorphic behavior is observed through function overloading or overriding. In the server file, the app.post('/api/user-data') and app.get('/api/user-info') endpoints demonstrate polymorphism by handling different HTTP methods (POST and GET) while sharing the same route path (/api/user-data). They exhibit different behaviors based on the type of HTTP request received.

Inheritance:
Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class can inherit properties and behavior from another class. While JavaScript does not support classical inheritance, it achieves similar functionality through prototype-based inheritance. In the server file, the UserInfo schema can be considered as inheriting properties and methods from the mongoose.Schema class, as it extends it to define the user data structure.

Modularity:
Modularity refers to the practice of breaking a program into smaller, self-contained modules that can be independently developed, tested, and maintained. In the server file, the use of require to import external modules such as express, mongoose, cors, etc., demonstrates modularity by breaking down the application into smaller, reusable components. Functions like app.post('/api/user-data') and app.get('/api/user-info') represent modular components responsible for specific tasks, such as handling user data and fetching user information.

User-Defined Function:
User-defined functions are custom functions created by the programmer to perform specific tasks. In the server file, functions like recommendRecipes() are user-defined functions tailored to the application's requirements. They encapsulate logic for recommending recipes based on user preferences and generating a report from recipe data
